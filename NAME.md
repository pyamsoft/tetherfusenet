# TetherFuseNet

The current name of the application is TetherFuseNet.

Previous versions before December 09, 2025 used to be named
"TetherFi" but the name was changed because it conflicted with
a different trademarked name in India.

Please see [Issue 468](https://github.com/pyamsoft/tetherfusenet/issues/468)
